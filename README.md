# ocamlings


## Here's the plan.

1. Learn OCaml
2. Create ocamlings
3. be able to answer "What is functional programming?"
4. billionaire


## Setup

1. Install ocaml/opam
2. opam init
3. opam install ocaml-lsp-server
4. opam install ocamlformat (optional)
5. dune was already installed now?! idk how that works.

## Progress

1. I don't know anything.
2. What is Janestreet and are they a type of mafia?
3. Apparently we are using dune now!
4. Why are paranthesis so special? Even the dune files use them.
5. dune build @fmt --auto-promote and dune fmt are the same thing.
6. What do double semi colons mean?!
7. executables are lost after reopening shell(eval $(opam env) into shell config is probably useful.)
8. Definitions are not expressions, nor are expressions definitionsâ€”they are distinct syntactic classes.
